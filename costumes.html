        <p>Popular Halloween costumes vary from year to year but often reflect current pop culture trends, classic characters, and timeless spooky themes. Some all-time favorite costumes include witches, vampires, ghosts, zombies, and skeletons, which are staples for anyone seeking a traditional Halloween vibe. Superheroes are always popular, with costumes like Spider-Man, Batman, and Wonder Woman regularly topping the list. Characters from popular TV shows and movies also make frequent appearances, such as Wednesday Addams, Barbie, or characters from franchises like "Harry Potter" and "Star Wars." Kids often opt for beloved Disney characters like Elsa or Buzz Lightyear. In recent years, trendy choices have emerged from video games like Fortnite or Minecraft, while meme-inspired outfits and celebrity looks have grown in popularity. Group costumes, like the cast of "Stranger Things" or "The Incredibles," are also a fun way for friends or families to dress up together.</p>
